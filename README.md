# What is this?

This is the [Nixos](http://nixos.org) configuration of my machine(s).

# Why?

So that others my learn either from my genius or my mistakes. The later gives much more opportunity to learnüòè.

Take a look, use it for inspiration, ask me questions about it via 'issues'.

# Isn't that insecure?

Hopefully I do not leak sensistive configuration in here without encrypting it. Don't worry, the initial hashed password in here is really just an initial password and gets changed as soon as a new machine is installed. Other secrets should be GPG encrypted‚Ä¶

And when I did not make any error, the tests should execute without the secrets using test data.
